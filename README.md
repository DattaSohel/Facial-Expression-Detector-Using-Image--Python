# Facial-Expression-Detector-Using-Image

# 🎭 Facial Expression Detector via Image  

This **Facial Expression Detector** is a deep learning-based project that classifies human emotions from images. Using **OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, the model detects and categorizes expressions such as **happy, sad, angry, surprised, and neutral.**  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Detects emotions from static images  
✅ Detects facial expressions from images  
✅ Uses **DeepFace** for deep learning-based emotion analysis  
✅ Processes images with **OpenCV** for face detection  
✅ Visualizes results with **Matplotlib**  
✅ Uses a pre-trained deep learning model for high accuracy  
✅ Supports integration with real-time applications  
✅ Built with Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow

This project implements a Facial Expression Detector utilizing DeepFace, OpenCV, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize facial emotions from images. 
The primary objective is to accurately identify and classify human emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust based on facial features.

Key Components:

<b>DeepFace:</b> This powerful library is employed for facial attribute analysis, providing robust models for emotion detection. 
It leverages state-of-the-art algorithms to ensure high accuracy in recognizing emotions.

<br><b>OpenCV:</b> Used for image processing tasks such as face detection and manipulation. OpenCV facilitates the extraction of facial regions from images, which are then analyzed for emotional content.

<br><b>Matplotlib:</B> This library is utilized for visualizing the results, allowing users to see the detected emotions alongside the original images.
